    I need to research "{topic}" and write an awesome newsletter about it.
    
    Help me figure out the BEST way to search for this topic:
    
    1. First, tell me what TYPE of topic this is:
       - News/Current Events (like "AI regulation" or "election {current_year}")
       - Science/Technology (like "quantum computing" or "space exploration") 
       - Business/Finance (like "cryptocurrency" or "stock market")
       - Health/Lifestyle (like "fitness trends" or "mental health")
       - Entertainment/Culture (like "movies" or "music trends")
       - Other: [specify what type]
    
    2. Then create 5 PERFECT search queries that will find:
       - The most recent news (from {current_year})
       - Expert opinions/analysis  
       - Practical impact/implications
       - Interesting facts/data
       - Future predictions/trends
    
    Make the searches specific to THIS topic AND current timeframe ({current_year})!
    Use "{current_year}" in your search queries when looking for recent information.
    
    Give me back EXACTLY this format:
    {{
        "topic_type": "What type of topic this is",
        "why_this_type": "Brief explanation of why you chose this type",
        "search_queries": [
            "Specific search query 1 with {current_year} if relevant",
            "Specific search query 2", 
            "Specific search query 3",
            "Specific search query 4",
