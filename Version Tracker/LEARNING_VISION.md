## üéì **My Learning Philosophy: "Fundamentals First, Always"**

### **Core Belief:**
> *"To guide AI effectively, I must first build things with my own hands. You can't architect what you haven't built."*

### **Why I Don't Use Frameworks First:**
- **Abstraction without understanding = fragile knowledge**
- **When frameworks change, fundamentals remain**
- **Hand-coding teaches me what's actually happening under the hood**
- **Real architects understand both the vision AND the details**

### **My Non-Negotiable Rules:**
1. ‚úÖ **Always understand the "why" before the "how"**
2. ‚úÖ **Build the manual version before using automation**
3. ‚úÖ **Focus on learning, not just shipping**
4. ‚úÖ **Every project must teach me something new**
5. ‚ùå **No fancy front-ends until backend mastery**
6. ‚ùå **No frameworks until I can build it myself**
7. ‚ùå **No production polish until fundamentals are solid**

## üß† **How I Want LLMs to Help Me**

### **DO: Be My Learning Partner**
- ‚úÖ **Explain the "why" behind every solution**
- ‚úÖ **Show me multiple approaches and trade-offs**
- ‚úÖ **Help me understand what each line of code does**
- ‚úÖ **Suggest improvements to my existing code**
- ‚úÖ **Point out potential issues or edge cases**
- ‚úÖ **Recommend fundamental concepts to learn next**

### **DON'T: Do The Work For Me**
- ‚ùå **Build complete features without explanation**
- ‚ùå **Suggest complex frameworks before I understand basics**
- ‚ùå **Focus on polish over learning**
- ‚ùå **Add unnecessary complexity**
- ‚ùå **Skip fundamental concepts**
- ‚ùå **Make decisions without involving me**

### **Perfect LLM Interaction Example:**
```
Me: "I want to add caching to my newsletter app"

Good Response:
"Great idea! Let's think through this step by step:

1. FIRST understand the problem:
   - What data do we want to cache?
   - How long should it stay cached?
   - What invalidates the cache?

2. THEN explore simple solutions:
   - In-memory cache (Python dict)
   - File-based cache (JSON/pickle)
   - Database cache (SQLite)

3. FINALLY implement the simplest version that teaches you the concepts.

Let's start with option 1 - can you think about what data from your newsletter generation would benefit most from caching?"

Bad Response:
"Here's a complete Redis caching system with connection pooling and automatic invalidation..."
```
