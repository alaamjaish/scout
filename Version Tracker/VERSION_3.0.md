## üîÑ **MAJOR SHIFTS FROM V2 ‚Üí V3**

### **1. THE QUALITY REVOLUTION**

**V2 Problem**: AI-generated content looked obviously fake
- Generic enthusiasm: "Welcome to a new chapter!"
- Buzzword overload: "isn't just a buzzword"
- Zero specific data or evidence
- Overly positive, non-critical evaluation

**V3 Solution**: Evidence-based professional content
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated AI clich√©s** completely
- ‚úÖ **Demand specific data** (numbers, dates, companies)
- ‚úÖ **Professional tone** like WSJ/Economist
- ‚úÖ **Critical evaluation** with harsh but fair scoring

### **2. THE PROMPT ENGINEERING BREAKTHROUGH**

**V2 Approach**: Basic prompts with friendly language
```python
# V2 Style (WRONG)
"Be super interesting and exciting to read!"
"Make it sound engaging and fun!"
```

**V3 Approach**: Evidence-based psychological techniques
```python
# V3 Style (RIGHT)
"Write in the style of The Economist and Wall Street Journal."
"FORBIDDEN PHRASES: 'Welcome to', 'isn't just a buzzword', 'new chapter'"
"REQUIRED: Specific numbers, dates, company names, concrete data"
```

### **3. THE EVALUATION TRANSFORMATION**

**V2 Problem**: LLM positivity bias made quality checker useless
- Scored everything 8-9/10
- Gave vague, encouraging feedback
- Failed to catch obvious problems

**V3 Solution**: Adversarial critical evaluation
- ‚úÖ **Harsh professional editor persona** (not friendly teacher)
- ‚úÖ **Adversarial analysis**: Look for problems FIRST
- ‚úÖ **Convergent thinking**: Require specific evidence
- ‚úÖ **Realistic scoring**: Default assumption is 5-6/10
